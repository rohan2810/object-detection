# Real Time Object and Velocity Detection

## Instructions for running project yourself
- The first step is to open the roboflow_yolo.ipynb file.
- Start running all the lines provided in the given script
- We have provided the roboflow API where we have labeled images of the Sphero (object which we want to detect)
- Running this script should take a while due to training the data through several epochs.
- Process can take anywhere from 30 minutes to multiple hours depending on hardware specifications.
- After running each and every line provided in the roboflow_yolo.ipynb file, you will see generated weights which you can export to yolov5. The folder structure should be yolov5/runs/train/real_exp/weights.
